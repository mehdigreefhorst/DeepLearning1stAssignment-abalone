# DeepLearning1stAssignment-abalone
 Project for JADS class of deeplearning

### Project setup
- Install a virtual environment (we used python 3.10.12)
    - `python -m venv venv`
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- create a folder ("data") and add the test.csv and train.csv in this folder
- Add the model with name "best_model.pth" in the same folder as the inference notebook
- Run the notebook inference.ipynb (this code is a subset of the code in the notebook Assignment.ipynb) You can also choose to run the complete Assignment-1.ipynb, you will get to the same resulting notebook. But as you only wanted to do inference this is how you do it.
